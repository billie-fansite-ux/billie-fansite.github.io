    <h3><a href=https://youtu.be/EgBJmlPo8Xw?list=RDEgBJmlPo8Xw“ target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; ">everything i wanted” (2019)</a>.</h3>
    <img src="everything-i-wanted-is-her-best-song-and-heres-why-body-text-v0-oanwnurm6hpe1.webp" id="img1">
    <p id="her">Meaning/History: This song is deeply personal—Billie wrote it about a dream she had where she died by suicide and the pressures of fame. It reflects her struggles with mental health, public scrutiny, and the feeling of isolation despite success. Importantly, it also highlights her close relationship with her brother Finneas, who reassures her in the song that he will always be there for her.

    Fun Fact: Billie has said that the song isn’t just about fame—it’s about the idea of having your dreams come true and realizing that it doesn’t automatically bring happiness. It won her a Grammy for Record of the Year, cementing it as one of her most impactful tracks.</p>

    <img src="artworks-000440150670-bwrp8q-t500x500.jpg" id="img2">
    <p id="that">Meaning/History: This track is about the emotional exhaustion and isolation that can come from intense relationships or fame. Billie has mentioned it captures the idea of feeling invisible or unseen despite putting on a façade for the world.

    Fun Fact: The music video, where she drinks black liquid that runs down her face, was visually striking and symbolic of internal pain being expressed externally. It’s often considered one of her most iconic and intimate performances.</p>
